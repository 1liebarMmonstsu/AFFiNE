## How to Use Fixel Contrastica 2 Ps
 
Fixel Contrastica 2 Ps is a simple and intuitive plugin that lets you adjust the contrast of your images in two ways: global contrast and local contrast. Global contrast affects the overall tonal range of the image, while local contrast affects the details and edges of the image. You can use both types of contrast together or separately, depending on your preference and needs.
 
To use Fixel Contrastica 2 Ps, follow these steps:

1. After opening the plugin interface, you will see two sliders: Global Contrast and Local Contrast. You can drag them left or right to increase or decrease the contrast values.
2. You can also choose from different presets for local contrast based on your image resolution: Low Resolution (480p), Standard Definition (720p), High Definition (1080p), Ultra High Definition (4K) or Ultra High Definition (8K). The presets are optimized for different levels of detail and sharpness.
3. You can also choose whether to apply the contrast effect on all channels (RGB) or only on the luminosity channel (L). Applying it on all channels will create a more saturated and colorful effect, while applying it on the luminosity channel will preserve the original colors of the image.
4. You can preview the effect on your image by checking or unchecking the Preview box at the bottom of the interface. You can also zoom in or out by using the + or - buttons at the bottom right corner 8cf37b1e13
